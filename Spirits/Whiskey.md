## Description
Whiskey is a type of liquor made from fermented grain mash. Various grains (which may be malted) are used for different varieties, including barley, corn, rye, and wheat. whiskey is typically aged in wooden casks, which are typically made of charred white oak. Uncharred white oak casks previously used for the aging of port, rum or sherry are also sometimes used.

### Single Malt Whiskey
Single malt whiskey is whiskey from a single distillery made from a mash that uses only one particular malted grain. Unless the whiskey is described as single-cask, it contains whiskey from many casks, and different years, so the blender can achieve a taste recognizable as typical of the distillery. In most cases, single malts bear the name of the distillery, with an age statement and perhaps some indication of some special treatments, such as maturation in a port wine cask.
### Blended Malt Whiskey
Blended malt whiskey is a mixture of single malt whiskies from different distilleries. If whiskey is labelled "pure malt" or just "malt" it is almost certainly a blended malt whiskey. This was formerly called a "vatted malt" whiskey.
### Blended Whiskey
Blended whiskey is made from a mixture of different types of whiskey. A blend may contain whiskey from many distilleries so that the blender can produce a flavor consistent with the brand. The brand name may, therefore, omit the name of a distillery. Most Scotch, Irish and Canadian whiskey is sold as part of a blend, even when the spirits are the product of one distillery, as is common in Canada. American blended whiskey may contain neutral spirits.
### Cask Strength Whiskey
Cask strength (also known as barrel proof) whiskies are rare, and usually, only the very best whiskies are bottled in this way. They are bottled from the cask undiluted or only lightly diluted.
### Single Cask Whiskey
Single cask (also known as single barrel) whiskies are bottled from an individual cask, and often the bottles are labelled with specific barrel and bottle numbers. The taste of these whiskies may vary substantially from cask to cask within a brand.
